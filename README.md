# MusicReviewWebsite
NAME(WIP) a music review and discovery website that lets users rate, review, and organize albums in a way that captures how listeners relate to and discover albums.

Inspired by the simplicity and community-driven feel of Letterboxd, this project explores music as a shared experience, emphasizing connection, relatability, and evolving taste through first impressions, revisits, and listener perspectives rather than the usual algorithmic discovery.

# Key Features _(subject to change)_
- Community-driven music discovery
- Rotation-based review visibility to ensure fair exposure
- Taste-weighted discovery using shared ratings and lists
- Followers for personal feeds, not global ranking
- Album-first reviews with optional track highlights
- Curated album lists

# Database & Data Sources

The website uses MusicBrainz for music metadata and the Cover Art Archive for album artwork. User reviews, ratings, lists, and interactions are stored in a relational database linked to MusicBrainz IDs, providing a consistent, flexible structure for discovery and future features.
